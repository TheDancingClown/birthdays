# I want a program that I can load in IRB that allows me to
# - Store all of my friendsâ€™ birthdays so I can keep track of them list.store
# - See them all at once with their names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format list.show
# - Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays I have stored and check each one to see if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s birthday, and tells me something like "It's Mary Poppin's birthday today! They are 124 years old!" - otherwise it won't say anything.
